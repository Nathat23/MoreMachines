# This is the parts file for a machine.
# A part is a armor stand which, when combined with several other armor stands, creates a unit.
# A unit is an object that can be used to represent progress.
#
# Each part and unit has to have its own unique id and section. Unit ids cannot be changed!!
# Each part can have an offset and can be a big or small armor stand.
# In addition, each unit can have a:
# 'hand-item' - item which is held in the hand
# 'head-item' - item which is placed on the head.
# 'chest-item' - item which is placed on the chest.
# 'leg-item' - item which is placed on the legs.
# 'foot-item' - item which is placed on the boots.
# Player heads can have custom skins if a ':' is added after the material name before the mojang head key.
